        "The watch shop was new filled with laugher and love. His wife, a kind and gentle woman, worked alongside him, helping customers.

The shop was their dream, and together, they created something special.",
        "Every morning, she would bring him a warm meal, and they’d sit together for a brief moment before the rush of the day began.Life was simple, and it felt like time moved slower when they were together. But that was before the earthquake.",

        "It was the same watch that had been in his wife’s hand when the earthquake took her away. Time, in that moment, had come to halt. The world had shattered around him, and in his heart, time itself had stopped. Time still stuck, frozen in that moment when his wife had died. The watch, still broken, was a constant reminder that no matter how much he tried, some things couldn’t be fixed.",
        "He had tried to move on, to live with the loss, but the watch… it haunted him. The ticks that had once brought peace now felt like a cruel reminder of the moment he couldn’t ever get back. He had lived with the watch for years, unable to throw it away, but never able to repair it either. The man who could fix anything… except for himself."
