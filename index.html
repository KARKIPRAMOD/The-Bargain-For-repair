          You're one of the few who will be reading A Bargain for Repair. That
          makes you a chosen one. Your review will be respected—so be as honest,
          blunt, or even brutal as you like. Just give me the raw feedback.

          The story follows a mysterious watchmaker who doesn’t just fix broken
          watches—he trades time itself. Each repair comes at a cost: the same
          amount of time taken from the owner’s life. But here’s the
          twist—trading time is just a metaphor. The real catch? That will only
          be revealed as the story takes shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          As different people step into his shop, they uncover a story of love,
          loss, and the weight of time. But despite his gift, there’s one watch
          he’s never been able to fix—his own. Dive in. Break it apart. Tell me
          what works and what doesn’t. Your feedback will shape what comes next.
